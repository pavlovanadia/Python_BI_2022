# NA manager usage #
## Repository information ##
NA manager is a script that allows you to process several simple actions with your nucleic acid sequences.
It requires user to type the command and then type the sequence of nucleic acid.

### The commands are following: ###
- **exit** - terminates the program
- **transcribe** - transcribes DNA to RNA
- **reverse** - reverses DNA or RNA sequence
- **complement** - prints the complement sequence
- **reverse complement** - prints the reverse complement sequence

### Please pay attention to: ###
- you can type commands in any register, but no other commands are available
- *complement* and *reverse complement* commands are sensitive to the type of the nucleic acid sequence and might require you to input it by typing *RNA* or *DNA* in any register
- sequence that you input is sensitive to the register, which means that the script will save the register of nucleotides respectively

## Installation and usage ##
To run NA manager you need to have any environment that supports Python3 installed.
